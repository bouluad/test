# App Teams Data Repository

## Repository Structure:

- **Root Directory:**
  - Create a top-level directory for your project, e.g., `AppTeamsData`.

- **Teams Directory:**
  - Create subdirectories for each app team using team names or unique identifiers.

    ```
    AppTeamsData/
    ├── TeamA/
    ├── TeamB/
    ├── TeamC/
    ```

- **Team Data Files:**
  - Store team-specific data within each team directory using structured formats like JSON or YAML.

    ```
    TeamA/
    ├── team_data.json
    ├── deployment_configs/
    │   ├── app1_config.yaml
    │   ├── app2_config.yaml
    └── secrets/
        ├── app1_secrets.yaml
        ├── app2_secrets.yaml
    ```

## Security Considerations:

1. **Private Repository:**
   - Ensure the repository is private to restrict access.

2. **Branch Protection:**
   - Enable branch protection rules for code reviews and approvals.

3. **Access Controls:**
   - Limit access to necessary team members and administrators using GitHub teams and access control lists (ACLs).

4. **Encryption:**
   - Consider encrypting sensitive files before storing them. Tools like `git-crypt` or `BlackBox` can help manage encrypted files.

5. **Use .gitignore:**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files or patterns.

6. **Code Scanning:**
   - Enable GitHub code scanning to find and alert on security vulnerabilities.

7. **Auditing and Monitoring:**
   - Regularly audit repository access and monitor changes. Use GitHub audit logs.

8. **Token Management:**
   - Use GitHub Personal Access Tokens with the least privilege necessary. Avoid hardcoding tokens in scripts.

9. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Conduct regular reviews of the repository, especially changes to access permissions.

10. **Educate Teams:**
    - Educate team members on GitHub best practices for security. Encourage two-factor authentication and provide guidelines on handling sensitive information.
